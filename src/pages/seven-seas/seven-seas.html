  <p>Officially sailing its ship on December 17, 2017, Seven Seas Waterpark has brought us back to our childhood memories and reignited our childish souls with the innocent joy brought by the twist and turns of its amazing water rides.</p>

  <p>The Seven Seas Waterpark experience is a breathtaking voyage and no matter how crazy the waves get, the adrenaline rush always leaves us wanting more.</p>

  <p>Seven Seas Waterpark is located at Brgy Barra, Opol, Cagayan de Oro City.</p>

  <h3 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">How to get there ?</h3>

  <p><strong style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">For mobiles</strong>: From the city proper, drive straight to Bulua Terminal and make a left turn on the Opol-Bulua Diversion Road, drive along the road and you’ll eventually locate Seven Seas Waterpark Entrance to your right.</p>

  <p><strong style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Grab a Grab Taxi</strong>: No ride? This is where the Grab App becomes handy. Book a trip with Grab. The cost would depend on your pick up point plus the booking fee. Grab will also be useful if you don’t have a ride when going home.</p>

  <p><strong style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Taxi</strong>:You can always ask a ride from Manong Driver, but to get a cheaper fare, lessen the distance between you and the Seven Seas Waterpark with available PUV’s traveling to Bulua Terminal.</p>
