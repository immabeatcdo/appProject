    <p>Hugo’s Skye Lounge (or Sierra del Oro?) is mainly a long stretch of dining options with a good overlooking view of the city. They have a restaurant, a snack shack, and a coffee shop. They also have a mini zoo that contains several birds, reptiles and a Tiger. You have to pay a Php 50 entrance fee for the whole area though.</p>

    <p>They also offer a paragliding activity, but the availability will depend on the weather condition and if the winds are favorable and strong enough for such activity.</p>

    <p>Aside from the Skye Lounge, Larry’s Hill is also located just a few blocks away from it. Now this is a different area which also requires another entrance fee (Php 50), and it is mostly an activity center for kids and every young adventurous soul. They have a ball pit, a wall climbing and rapeling area, and an obstacle course of hanging ropes.</p>
