  <p>High ridge is just like Jack Ridge of Davao City and both have the same ambiance. High Ridge is one of the famous restaurant in Cagayan de Oro City. I love the interior designs, the lights, the fresh air and overlooking view of the city. High ridge offers a very affordable and delicious foods on their menu and ranging from PHP100 – PHP350. The entrance fee is 100 pesos and its consumable, which mean you can order some food or drinks and use the entrance fee as your payment.</p>

  <p>While waiting for our food to be served – we played dice game, we talked to each other, laughed , asked questions and anything that comes These guys are my college classmates and we were so glad that we had this quality time – time to relax, eat and enjoy what life may bring.</p>

  <p>Located on a hilltop in Aluba, it gives you the best panoramic view of Cagayan de Oro especially at night. The area used to be a commercial establishment but was closed down by the city for "zoning violation." Since then High Ridge has been open to the public for outdoor picnics. Entrance fee is around 20 Pesos each. High Ridge requires a dress code and discourages people to bring pets, liquor or any glass bottled drinks. Visitors are requested to properly dispose off personal trash. There are no available public transportation in the area. You need to hire a vehicle or taxi and agree on a time to pick you up. High Ridge is open from 4 pm to 10 pm only.</p>
